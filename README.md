# Monopoly-Go-Hack---Secret-Way-To-Get-Free-Dice-Rolls-in-2025
Success in Monopoly GO hinges on the number of dice rolls at your disposal. With each roll you can continue to progress across the game board, snapping up properties at will. However, the number of dice rolls per day is limited, potentially halting your progress in the game. To combat this inactivity, you can collect additional dice rolls for free.

The Dice links normally work on Google Chrome browsers.

You can only use the free dice roll links once for each account, and you can't give any free rolls to your friends if you claim them. If any of these links don’t work, they might have expired. If a link doesn’t load properly, try using a different browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer.
Monopoly GO places the modest and absolute requirement of being at least level 15 to redeem codes for free dice rolls. It's common for games to apply a level requirement in order to access certain features to dissuade players from mass-creating new accounts and reaping the rewards. If you've had the game for some time, you're likely already level 15. Otherwise, you'll want to speed up the level-up process by building properties on your board.

Monopoly GO is an exciting new mobile game based on the classic board game Monopoly, but to play it on PC, players will need to download an emulator.

Click on the links shared above to see how many free dice rolls you've earned and to redeem them. The process is quick and simple, allowing you to jump right back into the game after the free rewards are claimed. As long as you meet the level 15 requirement, the links will take you directly to where you need to go.

Even though they have the name "Scopely Dice", the links above are to official pages, don't trust other accounts claiming to be official pages.

You don't always have to rely on outside websites to get dice rolls. You can earn them in the game, too. For instance, in Monopoly GO, you get free dice rolls by collecting Stickers for your Album. It's a good idea to check what you can do in the game to earn dice rolls before considering risky external sites for extra rewards. However, the quickest way will always be the official pages.

If you run out of dice rolls in Monopoly GO, you won't be able to move until you get your daily login rewards. In the meantime, you can always try to pay for more dice rolls, but that's a waste since these are replenished daily. It's just better to keep an eye out for more links and call it quits whenever you run out.
